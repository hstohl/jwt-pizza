# Incident: 2025-04-06 13-04-00

## Summary

```md
Between the hour of 13:04 and 13:09 on April 6, 2025, 12 users encountered issues placing a pizza order. The event was triggered by a chaos simulator at 13:05. This was done to test how the site and the team would react to a real issue in the system.

The event was detected by the Grafana metrics tracking pizza orders, and Grafana On Call. The team started working on the event by checking the logs where the issues were occurring. This serious incident affected 100% of users while it was happening.
```

## Detection

```md
This incident was detected when the Grafana Order Failure Alert was triggered and Hudson Stohl was paged.

Hudson Stohl immediately started working on the outage and had it fixed in minutes. He was new to looking through logs for specific issues such as this one, so it took him some extra time to find where the errors were occurring.

Team logging training will be set up by Hudson Stohl so that future on call team members will be better at sorting through the logs to quickly find the exact information needed to fix the error.
```

## Impact

```md
For 5 minutes between 18:04 UTC and 18:09 UTC on 04/06/25, pizza orders were not going through successfully. Any of our users who attempted to order a pizza during this downtime experienced this incident.

This incident affected 12 customers, 100% OF JWT Pizza users, who experienced an inability to order a pizza.
```

## Timeline

```md
All times are UTC.

- _05:55_ - It was indicated the system was ready to be chaos tested
- _13:04_ - First instance of pizza order failure
- _13:06_ - Team notified of the persistent order failures
- _13:06_ - Failure acknowledged by Hudson Stohl
- _13:09_ - Hudson Stohl fixes problem and marks alert as resolved
- _13:10_ - Pizza Order metrics return to expected
```

## Response

```md
After receiving a page at 13:06 UTC, Hudson Stohl came online at 13:06 UTC in the Grafana Pizza Dashboard.

This engineer did not have experience in sorting through logs, so it took a few extra minutes to find the issues. Once found, it was easy to turn off the chaos being induced into the system.
```

## Root cause

```md
Chaos induced into the system to test our system and our team caused pizza orders to fail for the 5 minutes that the chaos was running.
```

## Resolution

```md
By finding the correct link in the responses captured in the logs, visiting the endpoint "https://cs329.cs.byu.edu/api/report?apiKey=83568c99c72d45e2aa0b37687fd5a3fe&fixCode=b35c741ad43341a8b757d27960220ab3" turned off the chaos and returned the system to normal. The metrics quickly showed the increase of successful pizza orders and the decrease of failures.

Because the pizza order metric was showing failures, the logs for the order requests were checked, leading to the solution.

If there were more user using JWT Pizza, we'd be able to more quickly determine if something was seriously wrong with pizza ordering. With more data, Grafana could be set to update the orders metric more often, so the alert could be sent out after 30 seconds of consistent order failures, rather than two minutes. This would cut down time between our system going down and our team being notified. If the engineer had more practice sorting and filtering logs, they would have been able to find the issue quicker, cutting down on the fix time. This could potentially cut our already fast response time in half.
```

## Prevention

```md
This chaos was a planned test for our system and team. The root cause will only happen when we want it to.
```

## Action items

```md
1. Chaos testing is to be used wisely, to give us the information and confidence we want, while limiting the inconvenience.
```
